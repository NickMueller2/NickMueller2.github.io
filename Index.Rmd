## Biography {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Nicholas Mueller is an aspiring data scientist who started his educational journey at the University of Texas at Tyler. While at the University of Texas at Tyler he earned his BS in Nursing. From there he moved to Dallas, Texas to start his career at Baylor University Medical Center in the Medical Intensive Care Unit during the height of COVID-19. After one year on the ICU floor he left to pursue travel nursing around the United States helping ICUs in need of help in such a hard time. With the need of travel nurses slowing down he decided to change direction to another topic that he is truly passionate about, data science. Therefore, he applied to the SMU data science master program along with various online courses to prepare for the road ahead.

### Childhood

I was born in the great state of Wisconsin. Yes I really do love cheese. It was not until my 12th birthday when my family decided to move to the 2nd best state, Texas! Growing up my family was very supportive and unified, so the move to Texas was very easy. Though we had to leave our friends and loved ones, new adventures awaited us down south.

After finally making it to Texas our family settled down in a small town called Midlothian. Midlothian was full of some of the most amazing, welcoming, and kind people I have every met and it is where I have found my life long friends. Starting completely fresh in a new state at 12 years old was nerve wracking, however, I quickly made some awesome friend. After Middle school I continued my journey to Midlothian High school (MHS) and really started to dive into learning and practicing for the coming years. At MHS I was able to take several Pre-ap, AP, and college courses to really jump start my future. After my four years of hard work I accepting an offer to attend arguably the BEST college in west Texas, University of Texas at Tyler #GoPartiots.

### Hobbies

In my youth I was fortunate enough to explore several avenues of sports like wrestling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and just about anything else you can think of. But the one that stood out to be the most was disc golf. I loved the fact I could pick up a few discs and go play free rounds at my local disc golf park. The fresh air, hiking trails, and competitive atmosphere really drove me to become the best I could and make some amazing memories along the way!

### Career/Education

After graduating high school I was more eager than ever to learn all I could. After some hard thought and consideration I decided that I would pursue a degree in nursing. UT Tyler taught me a lot of lessons, one being that nothing in life comes easy and that if you truly want something enough you will need to put in the work to obtain it. So after 3 longer years of studying, I was finally a nurse.

```

Quickly after college I accepted a full time job at Baylor University Medical Center in downtown Dallas on the medical ICU floor in the height of COVID-19. There, I was blessed to be able to work beside the most talents and hard working people I have ever met. Everyone from the transport team to physicians were doing their part to help beat a horrible virus. Baylor taught me many thing and gave me a chance to make a difference not only in my life but others as well.
